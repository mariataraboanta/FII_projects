This project was completed in the first year of college, first semester, as part of the Introduction to Programming course. For this project, I worked alongside a classmate of mine. For the most part we worked together, but I was mainly involved with the layout of the app and the commands related to the electronic pieces (placing them on the screen, adding their capacity, zooming in/out, etc.).

Electron, a simple electronic schematic viewer, is a C++ project that was introductory to graphics.
