This project was completed in the second year of college, first semester, as part of the Rust Programming course. This was an individual project. It is an application that can receive big files and split them into several smaller files, as well as put them back together when given all the parts. These are some examples of how to run the application:

	- cargo run split a.zip -s 5b

	- cargo run unsplit a.zip

(Note: in order for the application to work, the file a.zip must be located in the same directory as the project.)
